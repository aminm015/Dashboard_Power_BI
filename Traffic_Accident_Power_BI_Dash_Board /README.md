Dataset Description
This dataset contains detailed information on traffic accidents across various regions and time periods. It includes various metrics such as accident date, weather conditions, lighting conditions, crash types, injuries, and vehicle involvement. The data spans multiple locations and accident types, offering a comprehensive view of traffic incidents and their causes.


ðŸ“Š Columns:
crash_date: The date the accident occurred.
traffic_control_device: The type of traffic control device involved (e.g., traffic light, sign).
weather_condition: The weather conditions at the time of the accident.
lighting_condition: The lighting conditions at the time of the accident.
first_crash_type: The initial type of the crash (e.g., head-on, rear-end).
trafficway_type: The type of roadway involved in the accident (e.g., highway, local road).
alignment: The alignment of the road where the accident occurred (e.g., straight, curved).
roadway_surface_cond: The condition of the roadway surface (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
road_defect: Any defects present on the road surface.
crash_type: The overall type of the crash.
intersection_related_i: Whether the accident was related to an intersection.
damage: The extent of the damage caused by the accident.
prim_contributory_cause: The primary cause contributing to the crash.
num_units: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.
